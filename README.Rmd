# Tutorial 10

Here are the files for this week's tutorial. Here we walk through how to use the gam function from the mgcv package, with a brief explainer at the end on how to get into reading source code from an R function. 

Please have a look at the .rmd and knitted html files for further information. I highly recommend having a look at the documentation for the mgcv package for anything that isn't clear.
